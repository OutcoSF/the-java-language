# Object Oriented Programming & Design 

You should be able to do the following for all the following in this README:
  
    Have a definition of the idea/concept without examples
    
    Have a couple examples you have rehearsed and can explain and code on the fly
 
### The Basic terms and things to know:
  
a. Class levels

 - Superclass

 - Base class
 
 - Subclass

b. Abstract base class (and difference from concrete class) 

 - Abstract method
 
 - How abstract vs concrete should they be?

c. Nested classes 

 - What is the purpose of each one of the following nested class types?
 
 - When do you use each one of the following nested class types?

 - Inner class
 
    - Local inner class 
    
    - Anonymous inner class
  
 - Static nested class
 
  
b. Inheritance
  
 - Is a, explain it.
 
 - When would you use inheritance over composition?
 
 - Does Java support multiple inheritance? If not, why not? 
  
c. Class has...
  
 - Instance variables (things a class knows about): <b> State </b>
  
 - Methods (things a class does): <b> Behavior </b>
  
d. Polymorphism (v. Overriding or Overloading)
  
e. Composition / aggregation
  
- Has a, explain it.

- When would you use composition over inheritance?

- Can an object be composed of multiple things? 
  
f. Multiple inheritance
  
g. Encapsulation
  
- Why do you need it?

- What do you use it for?
  
h. Interfaces ( aka  protocols)

- What are interfaces?
  
- What is the difference between an interface and abstract class?

i. Abstract class

- What is an abstract class?

- What is the difference between an abstract class and interface?
  
j. Methods
       
- Overriding

- Overloading (vs. overriding)

- Signatures (What is included in one)

- Visibility (e.g. public, private, protected, etc.)
  
k. Objects briefly explained 
  
- What is object a specific instance of?

- What differentiates objects from primitive types?

        Example: [TODO: add another example]

 
l. Object terms
  
- Singleton

- Initializer

- Constructor
  
   - Overloading

   - When are they called?
  
   - Why would you use one instead of an accessor/setter method?
  
- Instantiation

- Initialization

### Object Oriented Design (OOD):
    
### Be able to do the following when asked about OOD:
    
    Define it without examples
    
    Have examples and be able to explain them on the fly
    
    Why/when to use OOD vs. other paradigms

Object Oriented Design Principles (OODP) and Concepts:

- Abstraction
  
- Encapsulation 

- Robustness
  
- Adaptability
  
- Re-usability (D.R.Y)

- Open Closed Design Principle (SOLID)

- Modularity or Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- Dependency Injection or Inversion principle

- Favor Composition over Inheritance 

- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Programming for Interface not implementation

- Delegation principles
