# Functional Programming in Java

Why learn functional programming? 
Isn't object oriented design enough in Java? No. Java needs to adapt to using multicore CPUs and large
volumes of data. How will it do that? Part of the answer is functional programming features and techniques.
    
For testing code out, use the Java REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop): jshell
type the following into your terminal [read more here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java9/java9_repl.htm)

`$$ jshell`
